# Hulu Assessment
GitHub for Hulu Assessment, December 2021

How to Use:
To run the application, download the zip file and open up disney.html (make sure to have volume on and a decent level)
Use up/down/left/right arrow keys to move focus

Additional Features:
-Dynamically populated images using refId
-Disney+ logo
-Disney+ Startup sound

Noticable Issues:
1) New to Disney+ has two populated image sets
    -Tried to only have one but could not find a good, fast solution to fix the slight bug
2) Moving focus to right on certain images in dynamically populated
    -Certain times clicking the right arrow in the dynamically populated part of the page does not 
    change focus becuase it thinks it is at the end of the list. Tried my best to solve the issue overall by inserting 
    some standard checks.
3) View does not always move with focus
    -To do a full manipulation of focus and view point, I would have to do some deep digging into viewport. Have not
    touched any aspects of viewport for this situation. I would most likely spend a day or two researching and implementing
    a solution as well as ask my mentor for guidance.

Thank you to the Hulu Team for allowing me to take this assessment to show my knowledge.
